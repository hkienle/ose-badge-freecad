* Q&A
** 1. What were the videos that you studied to learn FreeCAD? Please include links.
I have been learning FreeCAD with version 0.19. I have primarily used
the offical Wiki documentation. Some resources I collected:
- flowwies corner https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyGwIx_PzM_zE3FKhZRbygQ
- FreeCAD Tutorial Part5 More 2D Constraints https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvHJdNfl0TU
- workflow https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Feature_editing#Body_building_workflow
- tutorial chrisb (PDF) https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/eZisrfTTCCjDEd9/download
- tutorial (triangles, golden ration, etc.) https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Sketcher_Tutorial
- best practice for a square https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Sketcher_Micro_Tutorial_-_Constraint_Practices
- major change from 0.16 -> 0.17 https://wiki.freecadweb.org/PartDesign_Legacy (page deleted!)
** Was Lesson 3A and 3B from FreeCAD 101 sufficient? How could we improve the lessons so you can get the FreeCAD Badge faster?
I did not watch them (before doing the exercise). The vidoes are a bit
rough and a bit lengthy, but nicely illustrate the hands-on approach that OSE takes.
** How long did it take you to install FreeCAD 16?
With AppImage, it is trivial. (But I am used to doing that. Biggest
hurdle on Linux is to make the file executable, I imagine.)
* How long did it take you to learn the skill to perform the Feature-on-a-Feature Exercise?
Cannot say, because I had some experience with FreeCAD 0.19
before. The major pain for me was the regression to 0.16:
- few shortcut keys and different pull-down menus
- less consistent sketcher interactions
- external geometry tool in the sketcher is more limited (it took me quite a while to find out what's working)
- occasional crashes
